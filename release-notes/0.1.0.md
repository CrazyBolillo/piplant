# Release 0.1.0
### Previous release: No previous release.
## Brief
This is the first release of piplant. It is NOT production
ready. It only implements the following functionality:

* Ambient (humidity / temperature) readings.
* On demand photos
* Turn on/off relays
* Basic info about the system (disk/cpu data)

This is supposed to be an async server but there are
probably some blocking lines of code which are yet
to be found and replaced.
